TimeTracker
===========

Simple and minimalistic task time tracking utility for Windows

The application creates an icon in the system tray. First click on the icon is registered as the start time of a task. Second click is captured as task end. A window pops up that lets the user specify name of the task that was just finished (or select one of the recent names) and saves the time period and task name to the log file (TimeTrack.txt in the Documents folder).

The log can then be examined and daily/weekly/monthly time reports can be produced.

There's nothing more to it; it's as simple as that.
